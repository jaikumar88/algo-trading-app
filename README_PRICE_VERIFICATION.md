# ‚úÖ REAL-TIME PRICE VERIFICATION - READY TO TEST

## What Just Got Implemented

‚úÖ **Real-time price verification** from Delta Exchange before opening ANY trade
‚úÖ **Detailed logging** showing exactly what's happening during price checks
‚úÖ **Automatic trade blocking** if price doesn't match market (>2% difference)
‚úÖ **Enhanced Telegram notifications** showing verification status

---

## Quick Start Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Trade monitor started
üöÄ TRADE MONITOR STARTED
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Test (in another terminal)

```bash
python tools\test_webhook_price_verification.py
```

**What happens:**
- Fetches current BTCUSD price from Delta Exchange
- Sends 3 test signals with different price points
- Shows which trades pass/fail verification

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Watch Logs in Flask Terminal

You'll now see these NEW log sections:

```
================================================================================
üìä STEP 1: VERIFYING REAL-TIME PRICE FROM DELTA EXCHANGE
================================================================================
Signal Price: $108450.0
Checking current market price for BTCUSD...
üîç Verifying price for BTCUSD: expected=$108450.00, tolerance=2.0%
üìä Market data for BTCUSD: Bid=$108449.00, Ask=$108451.00, Mid=$108450.00
‚úÖ Price verified for BTCUSD: signal=$108450.00, market=$108450.00, diff=0.00%
================================================================================
‚úÖ PRICE VERIFICATION PASSED
================================================================================
```

Or if price doesn't match:

```
================================================================================
‚ùå PRICE VERIFICATION FAILED - TRADE BLOCKED
================================================================================
Symbol: BTCUSD
Signal Price: $105000.0
Current Market Price: $108450.00
Reason: Price mismatch: expected 105000.0, current 108450.00 (diff: 3.28%)
‚ùå Trade will NOT be opened without price confirmation
================================================================================
```

## Test Script

üìù **Test Webhook Price Verification**
`tools/test_webhook_price_verification.py`

**Tests:**
1. ‚úÖ Signal with current price (should PASS)
2. üö´ Signal with 5% outdated price (should FAIL)
3. ‚úÖ Signal with 1% difference (should PASS)

---

## What You'll See

### In Flask Logs ‚úÖ
- `üìä STEP 1: VERIFYING REAL-TIME PRICE FROM DELTA EXCHANGE`
- `‚úÖ PRICE VERIFICATION PASSED`
- `‚ùå PRICE VERIFICATION FAILED - TRADE BLOCKED`

### In Telegram üì±
- Blocked trades show: `üö´ BLOCKED` with price details
- Allowed trades show: `üìà OPENED` with verified price

---

## Key Points

üîí **Safety First**
- NO trades open without price confirmation
- Automatic blocking if price mismatch >2%
- Better to miss trade than take bad one

üìä **Real-Time Data**
- Fetches live orderbook every time
- Calculates mid-price from best bid/ask
- Compares against signal price

üìù **Full Logging**
- See every step of verification
- Exact price comparison
- Clear pass/fail indicators

## Configuration

### Price Tolerance
Default: 2% (0.02)

To change, edit `src/services/delta_exchange_service.py`:
```python
def verify_price(self, symbol: str, expected_price: float, tolerance: float = 0.02):
```

### Trading Mode
File: `.env`

**Dry Run (current):**
```bash
DELTA_TRADING_ENABLED=false  # No orders placed, all verification logged
```

**Live Trading:**
```bash
DELTA_TRADING_ENABLED=true  # Orders placed after verification passes
```

---

## Ready to Test! üöÄ

```bash
# Terminal 1
python app.py

# Terminal 2
python tools\test_webhook_price_verification.py
```

Watch Terminal 1 for the detailed price verification logs!
