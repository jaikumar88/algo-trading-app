# What You'll See Now - Before & After Comparison

## BEFORE (What You Didn't See)

When webhook received a signal, logs looked like:

```
📥 INCOMING WEBHOOK REQUEST
Body: {"action": "BUY", "symbol": "BTCUSD", "price": 108450.0}
Extracted signal: action=BUY, symbol=BTCUSD, price=108450.0
✅ New event (not duplicate)
✅ Signal persisted to database

🔄 PROCESSING TRADE SIGNAL
Calling TradingManager.handle_signal: side=BUY, symbol=BTCUSD, price=108450.0
📈 Trade OPENED: BUY BTCUSD @ 108450.0
```

**Problem**: No price verification visible! Trade opens immediately without checking if price is still valid.
