# Risk Management System - Auto SL & Trailing Stop

## Overview
Automatic risk management system that continuously monitors all open trades and enforces:
- **Stop Loss (SL)**: Close trade at -1% loss
- **Trailing Stop**: Lock in profits at 2%, trail stop to 1%
- **Emergency Exit**: Close immediately on 10% spike

## Features Implemented

### 1. Stop Loss (-1%)
- Automatically closes trade when loss reaches 1%
- Applies to both BUY and SELL positions
- Logs: `üõë STOP LOSS`

**Example**:
```
Entry: $100,000
Current: $99,000 (-1%)
Action: CLOSE (Stop Loss Hit)
```

### 2. Trailing Stop (2% ‚Üí 1%)
- When profit reaches 2%, trailing stop activates
- If price falls back to 1% profit, position closes
- Locks in minimum 1% profit after reaching 2%
- Logs: `üìâ TRAILING STOP`

**Example**:
```
Entry: $100,000
Peak: $102,000 (+2%) ‚Üí Trailing activated
Current: $101,000 (+1%)
Action: CLOSE (Trailing Stop - profit secured)
```

### 3. Emergency Spike Exit (10%)
- Closes position immediately on 10% move (profit or loss)
- Protects against extreme volatility
- Logs: `üö® EMERGENCY SPIKE`

**Example**:
```
Entry: $100,000
Current: $110,000 (+10% spike)
Action: CLOSE (Emergency Exit)
```

## How It Works

### Background Monitor
File: `src/services/trade_monitor_service.py`

- Runs in background thread
- Checks every 5 seconds (configurable)
- Fetches live prices from Delta Exchange
- Evaluates all open trades against risk rules
- Automatically closes trades that hit limits

### Risk Manager
File: `src/services/risk_management_service.py`

- Calculates P&L for each trade
- Applies risk rules (SL, trailing, emergency)
- Determines which trades to close
- Updates database with exit details

### Integration
- Starts automatically with Flask app
- Works with Delta Exchange live trading
- Logs all actions for audit trail
- Updates Telegram notifications

## Configuration

### Risk Parameters
Located in `risk_management_service.py`:

```python
self.stop_loss_pct = Decimal('0.01')        # 1% stop loss
self.trailing_start_pct = Decimal('0.02')   # Start trailing at 2% profit
self.trailing_sl_pct = Decimal('0.01')      # Trail to 1% profit
self.emergency_spike_pct = Decimal('0.10')  # 10% emergency exit
```

### Monitor Interval
Located in `app.py`:

```python
monitor = get_trade_monitor(check_interval=5)  # Check every 5 seconds
```

## Testing

### Test Risk Scenarios
```bash
python tools\test_risk_management.py
```

Tests all scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Normal trade (no action)
- ‚úÖ Stop loss hit (-1%)
- ‚úÖ Trailing stop
- ‚úÖ Emergency spike (+10%)
- ‚úÖ Short positions

### Test with Real Trades
```bash
python tools\test_risk_management.py --real
```

Creates test trades in database and validates logic.

- Exit reasons recorded

## Production Checklist

Before enabling in production:

- [ ] Test all scenarios with test script
- [ ] Verify monitor starts with Flask app
- [ ] Check Delta Exchange API access
- [ ] Confirm price data fetching works
- [ ] Test with small position size first
- [ ] Monitor logs for first few hours
- [ ] Verify Telegram notifications
- [ ] Set appropriate check_interval (5-10s recommended)

## Customization

### Adjust Risk Parameters
Edit `src/services/risk_management_service.py`:

```python
# More aggressive (tighter stops)
self.stop_loss_pct = Decimal('0.005')  # 0.5% SL
self.trailing_start_pct = Decimal('0.01')  # Trail at 1%

# More conservative (wider stops)
self.stop_loss_pct = Decimal('0.02')  # 2% SL
self.trailing_start_pct = Decimal('0.05')  # Trail at 5%
```

### Change Monitor Frequency
Edit `app.py`:

```python
# Faster monitoring (more CPU)
monitor = get_trade_monitor(check_interval=2)  # Every 2 seconds

# Slower monitoring (less CPU)
monitor = get_trade_monitor(check_interval=10)  # Every 10 seconds
```
